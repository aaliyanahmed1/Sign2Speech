Sign2Speech - Professional Sign Language Interpreter
Project Summary and Technical Documentation

1. Project Overview
===================
Sign2Speech is a real-time sign language interpretation system that converts sign language gestures into natural speech. The system uses computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing to create a seamless bridge between sign language and spoken communication.

2. System Architecture
=====================
The project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

2.1 Core Components:
------------------
- YOLO12Detector: Custom YOLO model for sign language gesture detection
- DeepSORTTracker: Object tracking system for maintaining consistent gesture identification
- SentenceBuilder: Natural language processing for converting sign sequences to sentences
- TTSEngine: Text-to-speech conversion for audio output

2.2 Supporting Utilities:
-----------------------
- DrawingUtils: Visualization tools for bounding boxes and annotations
- VideoProcessor: Video frame handling and processing
- SystemLogger: Logging and monitoring system

3. Workflow Pipeline
===================
3.1 Input Processing:
-------------------
- Accepts both image and video inputs through a professional GUI interface
- Supports real-time video processing and batch image processing

3.2 Detection Pipeline:
---------------------
1. YOLO Detection:
   - Uses custom-trained YOLO12 model (sign.pt)
   - Detects 22 different sign language gestures
   - Implements confidence thresholding for reliable detection

2. Object Tracking:
   - DeepSORT algorithm for consistent tracking
   - Maintains gesture history and temporal consistency
   - Handles multiple simultaneous gestures

3.3 Language Processing:
----------------------
1. Sentence Building:
   - Converts gesture sequences into natural language
   - Uses grammar templates and phrase patterns
   - Implements context-aware sentence construction

2. Voice Generation:
   - Integrates with Ollama LLM for natural sentence generation
   - Uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion
   - Generates and manages audio files

4. User Interface
